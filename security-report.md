# Security Audit Report - Claude Code Raycast Extension

## Executive Summary

This security audit analyzed the Claude Code Raycast extension codebase for high-confidence security vulnerabilities. The extension primarily handles file operations, command execution, and user input processing. Overall, the codebase demonstrates good security practices with proper path handling and input validation. However, **one HIGH severity vulnerability was identified** related to command injection in the terminal launcher utility.

**Risk Assessment**: LOW to MEDIUM overall risk profile
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **High Vulnerabilities**: 1  
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **Low Vulnerabilities**: 2

The identified vulnerabilities are concentrated in command execution pathways and require specific attacker scenarios to exploit.

## High Vulnerabilities

### Command Injection in AppleScript Execution

- **Location**: `src/utils/terminalLauncher.ts:42-45, 52-58`
- **Description**: The `getTerminalCommand` function performs insufficient escaping of shell commands before passing them to AppleScript execution, potentially allowing command injection attacks.
- **Code Analysis**:
```typescript
function getTerminalCommand(terminalApp: TerminalApp, command: string): string {
  const escapedCommand = command.replace(/\\/g, "\\\\").replace(/"/g, '\\"');
  // AppleScript injection still possible through other special characters
```
- **Attack Vector**: If an attacker can control file paths through Finder selection or manipulate JSONL session files, they could inject malicious commands that would be executed when the AppleScript runs.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution with user privileges. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system if they can manipulate file paths or session data.
- **Exploitability**: MEDIUM - Requires attacker to control file paths or session data, but the extension processes user-selected files and parses external JSONL files.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive shell escaping using a proper shell escaping library
  - [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs before command construction
  - [ ] Use parameterized command execution instead of string concatenation
  - [ ] Add input validation to reject paths containing suspicious characters
  - [ ] Consider using macOS Security Framework APIs instead of shell commands
  - [ ] Implement command whitelisting for allowed operations
- **Code Fix Example**:
```typescript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

function shellEscape(arg: string): string {
  // Proper shell escaping that handles all special characters
  return "'" + arg.replace(/'/g, "'\"'\"'") + "'";
}

function getTerminalCommand(terminalApp: TerminalApp, command: string): string {
  const escapedCommand = shellEscape(command);
  // Use escaped command in AppleScript
}
```

## Low Vulnerabilities

### Path Traversal in File Operations

- **Location**: `src/userCommandManager.tsx:234-252`, `src/userAgentsManager.tsx:285-303`
- **Description**: File scanner utilities recursively traverse directories without adequate depth limits or path validation, potentially allowing access to unintended filesystem areas.
- **Code Analysis**:
```typescript
private scanDirectory(dir: string, commands: Command[], relativePath = ""): void {
  // No depth limit or path validation
  const items = readdirSync(dir);
  for (const item of items) {
    if (stat.isDirectory()) {
      this.scanDirectory(fullPath, commands, newRelativePath); // Unbounded recursion
    }
  }
}
```
- **Impact**: Information disclosure through filesystem traversal, potential DoS through deep directory structures
- **Exploitability**: LOW - Limited to scanning within ~/.claude/ directories, requires attacker to create malicious directory structures
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement maximum recursion depth limits (e.g., 10 levels)
  - [ ] Add path validation to ensure operations stay within intended directories
  - [ ] Implement directory traversal limits with proper boundary checking
  - [ ] Add symlink validation to prevent directory escape attacks
  - [ ] Log and monitor unusual directory traversal patterns
- **References**: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

### Insufficient Input Validation in YAML Parser

- **Location**: `src/userCommandManager.tsx:179-198`, `src/userAgentsManager.tsx:153-171`
- **Description**: Custom YAML parser implementation lacks comprehensive validation and error handling, potentially allowing malformed input to cause unexpected behavior.
- **Code Analysis**:
```typescript
private parseYAML(yamlContent: string): Record<string, unknown> {
  // Simple parser without comprehensive validation
  for (const line of lines) {
    const colonIndex = line.indexOf(":");
    if (colonIndex === -1) continue; // Insufficient validation
    // Direct assignment without sanitization
    result[key] = value.replace(/"/g, "");
  }
}
```
- **Impact**: Application instability, potential information disclosure through parser errors
- **Exploitability**: LOW - Requires attacker to control YAML file contents in ~/.claude/ directories
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Use a well-tested YAML parsing library (js-yaml, yaml) instead of custom implementation
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Add error handling for malformed YAML content
  - [ ] Implement size limits for YAML files to prevent resource exhaustion
  - [ ] Add schema validation for expected YAML structure
  - [ ] Sanitize all parsed values before use in the application
- **References**: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

## Security Posture Assessment

### Positive Security Practices Observed

1. **Proper Path Handling**: Code uses `join()` and proper path manipulation functions
2. **User Confirmation**: Destructive operations require user confirmation via `confirmAlert()`
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
4. **File Size Limits**: Session parsing implements file size limits (10MB) to prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Input Sanitization**: Basic input sanitization in form inputs and file operations
6. **Directory Validation**: Checks for directory existence and proper permissions

### Areas of Concern

1. **Command Execution**: Direct shell command execution through AppleScript without comprehensive escaping
2. **File Parsing**: Custom parsers for JSONL and YAML without robust validation
3. **External Data Processing**: Processing of external JSONL session files without full validation
4. **Path Operations**: Recursive directory operations without depth limits

## General Security Recommendations

- [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation library for all user inputs
- [ ] Replace custom parsers with well-tested libraries (js-yaml, etc.)
- [ ] Add content security policies for file operations
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring for security-relevant operations
- [ ] Add rate limiting for file operations to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Conduct regular security testing of command execution pathways
- [ ] Implement privilege separation where possible
- [ ] Add security headers and validation for all external data processing

## Security Posture Improvement Plan

### Phase 1 (Immediate - High Priority)
1. **Fix Command Injection Vulnerability**: Implement proper shell escaping in terminal launcher
2. **Enhance Input Validation**: Add comprehensive validation for all user inputs
3. **Security Testing**: Implement automated security testing for command execution

### Phase 2 (Short Term - Medium Priority)
1. **Replace Custom Parsers**: Migrate to well-tested parsing libraries
2. **Add Depth Limits**: Implement recursion and traversal limits
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Add security-relevant operation logging

### Phase 3 (Long Term - Lower Priority)
1. **Security Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for unusual patterns
2. **Code Review Process**: Establish security-focused code review practices
3. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments

## Conclusion

The Claude Code Raycast extension maintains a generally good security posture with proper file handling and user interaction patterns. The primary concern is the command injection vulnerability in the terminal launcher, which should be addressed immediately. The codebase benefits from good error handling and user confirmation patterns, but would benefit from more robust input validation and the use of well-tested parsing libraries.
